This repository contains our projects about Natural Language Processing:


* The creation of a dataset sourced from the Italian version of Wikipedia, which was used to train a **word2vec model for word embedding**.

* The development of a custom transformer encoder from scratch, which was used to perform **sentiment analysis on Italian tweets**. Performance has been compared with a random forest classifier.
