# WIKIPEDIA DATALOADER AND WORD EMPEDDING

*Build a dataset from wikipedia ITA for feeding a word2vec model*

## Folder files

- `make_dataset.py` Download and pre-process wikipedia dump. It takes some time for executing;
- `loader.py` Code for loading couples word/embedding from wikipedia dump;
- `/../dataset` folder containing pre-processed dataset and index files. Automatically generated;
- `ruby_postprocessing.py` Some postprocessing for files obtained using `wp2txt`;
- `model.py` Code for different versions of word2vec;
- `test.py` Plot and compare word embedding obtained with our model;
- `w2v.ppy` Train a word embedding model;
- `word_frequency.py` Some calculations to estimating frequency distribution of words
and testing different parameters for skipping more frequent words.

## Generating the dataset

### Option A
run `make_dataset.py` with the following parameter:

```run(process_xml=True)```

The script will download italian dump of wikipedia and will process
xml

PROS
 - Quick and easy

CONS:
 - Processed file contains some errors


### Option B
run `make_dataset.py` with the following parameter:

```run(process_xml=False)```

The script will just download and uncompress italian dump of wikipedia.

You will need ruby (for windows users look here: https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads)

Install `wp2txt`  (https://github.com/yohasebe/wp2txt) . On ruby console type: 

```gem install wp2txt```

Once the package is installed, in the `dataset` folder :

```wp2txt -i wiki_it.xml```

After some time (~1h on my laptop) all the xml will be processed.

However, you still need removing titles (==Caratteristiche==), 
text inside brackets ([[Chiesa di Notre-Dame-de-la-Basse-Å’uvre]]) 
and lines containing categories.
Also, you get lots of files.

Run `ruby_postprocessing.py` for merging all chunks and remove special lines.

PROS
 - Processed file is cleaner

CONS:
 - You need ruby
 - More steps 

## Train the model

Run `w2v.py`. Attention, old model saved will be overwritten at each execution, so make a manual backup if you want to keep a save.

## Test a model

Ru `test.py`, feel free to add your own examples.
